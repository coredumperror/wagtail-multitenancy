Right now, this is just a haphazard collection of the code we wrote to make this
all work. It is not intended to be a functional Django app. Yet.

One of the biggest limitations we ran into was the impossibility of swapping in
a new Group and Collection model. This meant that we could not directly relate
the Collections and Groups to each Site, which is why there is so much janky code
that "relates" them through the string value of the Site's hostname.

One of the design philosophies we went with is "Only Superusers have permission
to see more than one Site's contents at a time". Everyone else can only see the
contents of Sites to which they are members. A user is a member of a Site if they
belong to eithe the "Admins" or "Editors" Group for that site (the group name
starts with that Site's hostname).

Generally, Superusers are meant to do only a few things: create new Sites, create
the first Admin for a new Site, and perform high-level maintenance. They *could*
do other things, but are discouraged from doing so, to avoid accidentally doing
something to the wrong Site. Instead, if they intend to administer a Site, they
should add their LDAPUser to a Site's Admins group, then log in to that site as
that user. Also, LDAPUsers are discouraged from being made into Superusers.
Suprusers are "special", and should therefore be defined as custom LocalUsers.
